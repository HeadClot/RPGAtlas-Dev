# Phase M6 Spec — Wizard polish, docs, QA, release ("Project Compass")

**Status:** M6·A ✅ COMPLETE (branch `mig-6a`) · M6·B ⏳ next · M6·C ⏳ (Fable
release gate). Phase M6 is the *finish*: the migration works (M1–M5 landed the
conversion, parity, plugins, and the read-only Script adapter); M6 makes it
*friendly to use* (M6·A), *proven at scale* (M6·B), and *shipped* (M6·C, tag
`mig-6` + version **1.1.0**).

**Authored:** 2026-07-05 by Claude Opus 4.8 (High), from the M6 section of
`docs/MZ_MV_MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` (phase M6 + locked decision 6) and the M1·D
wizard/report UI (`rm-import-wizard.ts`).
**Branch (per step):** `mig-6a`, `mig-6b`, `mig-6c` — each merges to `main`
(locked decision 2). Phase exit (M6·C) tags `mig-6` and `v1.1.0`.
**Model:** Opus 4.8 (High) for A/B; Fable 5 for the C release gate. Sonnet is
banned from RPGAtlas.

## Locked decisions inherited from the roadmap / mig-0

1. Opus 4.8 does the work; Fable gates M0·C and M6·C; **Sonnet banned**.
2. Git ritual after every step: branch `mig-<phase><step>` → tests green → commit
   → push → merge to `main` → push `main` → delete branch. Phase exit tags `mig-N`.
3. Hand-off: each step ends by printing the next step's kick-off prompt verbatim.
4. Format: importer writes FORMAT_VERSION 2; new fields are **optional additive**
   only. No FORMAT_VERSION bump without the Fable gate.
5. Legal: only the user's own project imports; plugin `.js` is never executed;
   fixtures are hand-authored.
6. **Audience rule:** wizard text, progress, reports, and errors are for kids and
   first-time devs — "here's what came along and what to do", never a stack trace.

## M6·A objective (this step)

Polish the wizard's **user face** and write the **"Coming from RPG Maker MZ/MV"**
documentation. Three UX deliverables from the roadmap (M6·A): **progress states**
(a live bar, not a frozen spinner), a **re-import flow** (re-run picks up table
entries that have since flipped from `mzTodo` to a real conversion — and *says*
how many), and **report export as text**. Plus the docs: a wiki guide, docs-site
rebuild, README mention, help.ts refresh, patch notes, version bumps.

### What M6·A does NOT do (guardrails)

- **No new conversion behavior.** The importer's coverage is exactly what M1–M5
  shipped; M6·A only changes how the *wizard* presents it. Re-import re-runs the
  same pipeline — it picks up newly-supported entries only because the *code* got
  better between imports, never because M6·A converts anything new.
- **No FORMAT_VERSION bump** (D4). No schema change at all — the report doc shape
  is untouched; the new helpers are pure functions over it.
- **Text export & delta stay pure** (src/shared pure-core trap): the wording lives
  in a node-testable module, not the DOM, so the vitest spec owns the copy.
- **Kid-safe copy** (D6): progress labels, the re-import banner, and the text
  report never leak a stack trace or code noise.

## Deliverables (M6·A)

1. **`src/editor/importers/mz/report-format.ts`** (new, pure) — `reportDocToText`
   (a saved `ImportReportDoc` → a plain-text file, same voice as the on-screen
   report), `reimportDelta(prev, next)` (compares todo-weight so the wizard only
   celebrates a genuine improvement), and `PLUGIN_VERDICT_WORD` (one source of
   truth for the verdict icon+word, shared by the text export and the DOM badge).
2. **`src/editor/importers/mz/import-run.ts`** — `runRmImport` gains an optional
   `onProgress` sink (`ImportProgress` / `ImportProgressFn`) awaited between the
   heavy stages (reading → assembling → report → done) so the wizard can repaint.
3. **`src/editor/importers/mz/index.ts`** — re-exports the new helpers + types.
4. **`src/editor/importers/rm-import-wizard.ts`** — live progress modal (label +
   bar, driven by `onProgress` with a paint yield); the report modal grows a
   custom footer with **💾 Save as Text…** / **📋 Copy** (which don't dismiss);
   `renderReportDoc(doc, prev?)` renders the 🔁 re-import banner; the launcher
   nudges toward re-import when the project already carries a report; the plugin
   badge now builds on the shared `PLUGIN_VERDICT_WORD`.
5. **Docs** — new `wiki/Coming-from-RPG-Maker.md` (how-to, the report, a
   term-by-term cheat sheet, add-ons, script snippets, re-import, artwork,
   troubleshooting); `_Sidebar.md` entry; cross-links from `Home.md` and
   `Migration-Guide.md`; README mention; `docs-site/` rebuilt
   (`node scripts/build-docs-site.mjs`).
6. **help.ts** — "Coming from RPG Maker" section gains the progress/save/re-import
   bullets; **patch notes** entry; `?v=` bump 55→56 (help.ts import + shims.d.ts).
7. **Tests** — `tests-unit/mz-report-format.test.ts` (text export shape + kid-safe
   copy + delta math incl. count-weighting and singular/neutral copy);
   `tests-unit/mz-import-wizard.test.ts` gains a progress-order assertion.

## Stage log

### M6·A — UX polish + "Coming from RPG Maker" docs — ✅ 2026-07-05 (branch `mig-6a`)

**Delivered:**
1. **`src/editor/importers/mz/report-format.ts`** (new, pure — no DOM/`window`):
   - **`reportDocToText(doc)`** renders the report as a saveable `.txt` in the
     same order as the on-screen version — header (MV/MZ + game title), the
     good-news summary counts (zeros omitted), the honest caveat buckets
     (partial → "Came in a little differently", todo → "Saved for a later
     update", skipped → "Left out on purpose", converted → "Notes"), the add-ons
     section, "What next?" (incl. the re-import tip), and a dated provenance line.
   - **`reimportDelta(prev, next)`** compares **todo weight** (sums each todo
     line's aggregate `count`, so "damage formulas — seen 7 times" counts as 7),
     returning `{ improved, prevTodo, nowTodo, resolved, headline }`. Headline is
     green + celebratory only when `next` has strictly fewer todos than `prev`
     (singular/plural aware), neutral "nothing new yet" when unchanged, and
     `null` when there's no previous report — so the banner never nags.
   - **`PLUGIN_VERDICT_WORD`** — the verdict → {icon, word} table, now the single
     source of truth (the wizard's colored badge composes tint onto it).
2. **`import-run.ts`** — `runRmImport(source, base, onProgress?)`; `ImportProgress`
   = `{ stage: "reading"|"assembling"|"report"|"done", label, step, total }`;
   `onProgress` is **awaited** between stages, so the wizard's sink can yield a
   macrotask and repaint before the synchronous convert blocks. Omitting it is
   the silent test/legacy path — the existing two-arg callers are unaffected.
3. **`index.ts`** — re-exports `reportDocToText`, `reimportDelta`,
   `PLUGIN_VERDICT_WORD`, `ReimportDelta`, `ImportProgress`, `ImportProgressFn`.
4. **`rm-import-wizard.ts`** — progress modal (label + green fill bar) fed by an
   `onProgress` that sets width `step/total` and `await setTimeout(0)` to paint;
   `importFromSource` remembers the project's prior report **before** commit and
   passes it to `showReport(doc, prev)`; `renderReportDoc(doc, prev?)` prepends a
   🔁 banner from `reimportDelta` (green when improved, grey when neutral); the
   report modal uses a **custom footer** (Save-as-Text + Copy must NOT dismiss, so
   they're their own buttons with a late-bound `close`); the launcher shows a
   re-import nudge when `hasImportReport()`; `PLUGIN_BADGE` now derives icon+word
   from `PLUGIN_VERDICT_WORD` (only `PLUGIN_TINT` stays local).
5. **Docs** — `wiki/Coming-from-RPG-Maker.md` (new, kid-friendly on-ramp: how to
   import, the report, a "what comes across" table + a RPG-Maker→Atlas term
   cheat-sheet, add-ons guidance, the read-only script subset, artwork via the
   Asset Browser, the re-import flow, and an "if something looks off" section);
   `_Sidebar.md` gains it under Getting started; `Home.md` + `Migration-Guide.md`
   cross-link it (and Migration-Guide now disambiguates "project-format upgrade"
   from "coming from RPG Maker"); README doc block gains a 🎮 line; `docs-site/`
   rebuilt (20 pages — the new page + every page's nav).
6. **help.ts** — the "Coming from RPG Maker MZ / MV?" section gains the
   progress-bar / Save-as-Text / Copy / re-import bullets; **patch notes** entry
   ("Smoother RPG Maker imports"); `?v=` bump 55→56 (help.ts import + shims.d.ts).
7. **Tests** — `tests-unit/mz-report-format.test.ts` (11: text export leads with
   counts + omits zeros, MV/MZ naming, clean-vs-caveat headings, add-ons verdict
   words + on/off + settings, next-steps + dated provenance + kid-safe scan; delta
   neutral-with-no-prev, celebrate-fewer, singular copy, count-weighting,
   nothing-new-when-equal). `tests-unit/mz-import-wizard.test.ts` gains a
   progress-order assertion (stages `reading→assembling→report→done`, steps 1–4,
   total 4, still imports "Cove Test").

**Guardrails held:** no new conversion behavior (re-import re-runs the same M1–M5
pipeline; the delta only reflects code that improved between imports); no
FORMAT_VERSION bump and no schema change (D4); the copy lives in a pure
node-tested module (src/shared pure-core discipline); kid-safe scan asserts no
stack-trace noise in the text report (D6).

**Gates green:** `tsc --noEmit` clean · vitest **861** (was 849, +12) · node
`--test tests/` **18** · Playwright **70/70** · eslint clean on all changed files
(main's 3 pre-existing errors untouched — lint is not a phase gate).
patch-notes `?v=56`.

**Next:** M6·B — round-trip QA & scale test (both fixtures + a script-generated
50+ map / 500+ event / full-DB community-scale project; full e2e chain,
import-time perf budget, bug bash, report-copy review).
