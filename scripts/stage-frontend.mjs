/* RPGAtlas — scripts/stage-frontend.mjs
   Builds the web frontend with Vite and stages the build output into
   src-tauri/dist so Tauri can embed it, then generates img/assets.json so
   custom-art discovery works inside the desktop app (which has no HTTP
   directory listings).

   Phase 1 Stage A: the editor/player now load ES module entries bundled by
   Vite (index.html/play.html reference /src/…/main.ts in dev, rewritten to
   hashed dist chunks by `vite build`), and the standalone export inlines
   dist/player-bundle.js. So we can no longer stage the raw source tree — the
   raw HTML would point at /src/…/main.ts, which the packaged app can't serve.
   We therefore run `vite build` and stage the built dist/ (which already
   contains the rewritten HTML, hashed entry chunks, player-bundle.js, and the
   verbatim css/img/bin/js passthrough — see vite.config.mjs). The web build
   output is otherwise left untouched; this manifest only lives in the staged
   copy. GPL-3.0-or-later. */
