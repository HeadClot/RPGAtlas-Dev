# Troubleshooting & FAQ

Quick fixes for the snags people hit most. If your problem isn't here, check the
[Resources & Glossary](Resources-and-Glossary) or the project's `README.md`.

---

## Starting up

### Nothing happens / the editor won't load when I double-click `RPGAtlas.exe`
- Make sure `RPGAtlas.exe` is **inside the RPGAtlas folder**, next to `index.html`. It serves the
  folder it lives in; moved on its own, it can't find the engine.
- Look at the little black window — it prints the address (usually `http://localhost:8080/`) and any
  error. Open that address in your browser manually if a tab didn't pop up.

### "RPGAtlas needs its one-time setup first"
This only appears when running from a **source checkout** (downloaded copies are pre-built and never
need it). The editor's tooling has to be downloaded once: open a terminal in the RPGAtlas folder
(in File Explorer, click the address bar, type `cmd`, press Enter) and run `npm install`. When it
finishes, double-click `RPGAtlas.exe` again. See
[Installation & Setup](Installation-and-Setup#running-from-a-source-checkout-git-clone).

### "RPGAtlas could not start Node.js (is it installed?)"
Running from a source checkout needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **18 or newer** on your computer.
Install the LTS version from nodejs.org (one-time), then run `RPGAtlas.exe` again.

### "Windows protected your PC" / unknown publisher
Expected — the launcher is **unsigned**. Click **More info ▸ Run anyway**. It only starts a local
server and opens your browser. See [Installation & Setup](Installation-and-Setup#windows-protected-your-pc--unknown-publisher).

### "Could not find a free local port (8080-8099)"
Other programs are using all of those ports — usually other copies of RPGAtlas. Close other RPGAtlas
windows and try again; the launcher picks the first free port in the 8080–8099 range automatically.

### I opened `index.html` directly and it's broken
Browsers block `localStorage` and asset scanning on `file://` pages (and a source checkout's
TypeScript editor can't run without the dev server at all). You **must** start RPGAtlas properly —
use `RPGAtlas.exe` (Windows), `python -m http.server 8080` (pre-built copy), or `npm run dev`
(source checkout). See [Installation & Setup](Installation-and-Setup).

### The browser opens on its own and I don't want it to
Start the launcher with the `--no-browser` flag (`RPGAtlas.exe --no-browser`), then open the printed
address yourself.

## My work

### Where is my project saved? Will I lose it?
The editor **auto-saves to your browser** (`localStorage`). That's convenient but fragile: it's tied
to one browser on one computer, and clearing browser data erases it. **Always keep a `.json` backup**
via **File ▸ Save Project**. Treat the `.json` as your real save file.

### I switched browsers/computers and my game is gone
The auto-save doesn't travel between browsers. Use the **`.json`** you exported (**File ▸ Open
Project** to load it). If you never saved one, the work only exists in the original browser's storage.

### Undo only goes back so far
Undo/redo is generous (full-map history for tiles, shadows, heights, passability, and events) but not
infinite. Save `.json` checkpoints at milestones.

---

## Maps & assets

### My custom art doesn't appear in the editor
- Confirm files are in the **correct `img` subfolder** (`characters`, `facesets`, `enemies`,
  `tilesets`, `system`) and are valid PNG/WebP/JPG. See
  [Characters & Custom Assets](Characters-and-Custom-Assets).
- **Reload the editor** after adding files.
- On a **source checkout** the Vite dev server (what `RPGAtlas.exe` and `npm run dev` run there)
  doesn't provide the directory listings the scan reads — run `tools/update-assets.ps1` to write a
  manifest (`img/assets.json`), then reload. Downloaded copies aren't affected: the launcher's
  built-in server (and `python -m http.server`) provide listings, so the scan just works.

### The player can walk through a wall (or can't cross a bridge)
Passability comes from the topmost tile, but you can fix any cell directly: switch to
**Passability mode** and click the tile to cycle auto → block → pass. For custom tiles, filename
suffixes like `.pass` and `.terrain` set defaults. See
[Maps & Tiles](Maps-and-Tiles#passability--where-the-player-can-walk).

### My HD-2D map looks flat / like normal 2D
HD-2D is **opt-in per map** (enable it in Map Properties) and **falls back to flat 2D** on devices
that can't run WebGL2. Heights only extrude in HD-2D maps. See
[Maps & Tiles](Maps-and-Tiles#hd-2d-heights).

---

## Events

### My event does nothing / the wrong page runs
- Check the **trigger** — Action Button needs the player to face it and press Z/Enter; Player Touch
  needs them to step on it.
- Remember pages resolve **last-match-wins**. If a later page's conditions are met, it overrides
  earlier ones. See [Events](Events#pages-and-conditions).

### The game froze during a cutscene
An **Autorun** page with no end condition runs forever. Make the page flip a **switch/self-switch** at
its end, and add an empty page whose condition is that flag, so the event stops. See
[Events](Events#triggers--what-starts-an-event).

### A chest gives its item every time
You're missing the **self-switch**. Set Self-Switch A = ON after the reward, and add a second page
conditioned on Self-Switch A being ON. See
[Events](Events#recipes).

---

## Battles

### Battles are too hard / too easy
Tune enemy **stats and rewards** and your **class growth** in the [Database](The-Database). Playtest a
fresh party through the area. See [Battles & States](Battles-and-States#tips-for-fun-fair-combat).

### Random encounters never happen (or happen constantly)
Encounters and their **rate** live in **Map Properties**, and the map needs **troops** assigned. A
lower rate means *more* frequent battles. See [Maps & Tiles](Maps-and-Tiles#random-encounters).

---

## Accessibility

Every game made with RPGAtlas ships with these player-side options (in-game **Options** menu, saved
per player, no authoring needed):

- **Reduced Motion** (Auto / On / Off) — stills screen shake, battle sprite bobbing and lunges,
  HUD flash effects, halves full-screen flashes, and thins weather particles. *Auto* follows the
  player's operating-system "reduce motion" setting.
- **Text Size** (Small / Normal / Large / Huge) — scales dialogue and menu text over the game's
  authored base font size.
- **Colorblind Assist** — switches HP/MP gauges to a colorblind-safe orange/sky-blue palette
  (damage and healing popups always carry explicit −/+ signs, so color is never the only signal).
- Screen Shake (Off / Reduced / Full) and per-channel volume sliders have been there since earlier
  releases.

Editor side: **Help ▸ Interface Language…** now also sets a **UI Font Size** (90–125%) for the
editor chrome on this device.

## Performance

### How do I see what my game's frame rate is?
Press **F3** during play (playtest or an exported game), or add `?perf=1` to the player URL. The
performance overlay shows fps, frame time (average and 95th percentile), the engine's per-frame work
time, HD-2D draw calls and triangles, live GPU resource counts, and JS heap use (Chromium browsers).
Press F3 again to hide it.

### My HD-2D map is slow on an older machine
Every HD-2D feature is a per-map toggle in **Map Properties** — shadows, water reflections, SSAO,
depth of field, and bloom are the heaviest. Turn them off map-by-map, or lower the game's screen
size in the **Database ▸ System** tab. The engine is tuned to hold 60 fps at 1080p on integrated
GPUs with everything on, but very old GPUs (or browsers with hardware acceleration disabled —
check the overlay's frame time) may need trimming.

### Does a huge map hurt performance?
Big maps are fine: terrain renders in view-culled chunks, so a 160×160 map with hundreds of events
holds the same frame budget as a small one (this is enforced by an automated stress test). What
*does* add up is hundreds of **parallel-trigger events running long command loops** — prefer
touch/action triggers where possible.

## Publishing

### My exported EXE triggers a virus/security warning
The launcher is unsigned, so SmartScreen/antivirus may flag downloaded builds. Players use **More
info ▸ Run anyway**, or distribute the **Standalone HTML** build instead. See
[Publishing Your Game](Publishing-Your-Game#the-unsigned-exe-warning).

### Players say their saves disappeared
Browser saves are **per browser/computer**. If a player switches browsers or clears data, their saves
go with it — that's inherent to browser games, not a bug.

## Frequently asked

**Do I need to know how to code?** No. Maps, events, and the database cover full games. Code (via
[Plugins](Plugins) or the Script command) is optional.

**Does it cost anything?** No. RPGAtlas is free and open-source (GPL-3.0).

**Can I sell games I make?** Yes — your content is yours, no credit required.

**Does it work offline?** Yes. Once you have the folder, nothing needs the internet.

**Can I use my own music or art?** Yes for art (drop files in `img/`). Audio is procedural; custom
audio tracks aren't a built-in feature, but plugins can extend the engine.

**Where do old Driftwood Engine projects go?** They open and migrate automatically — autosaves, save
slots, and bundled plugins all carry forward.
