    title: "Simple RPG Maker scripts now run: switches, variables & party checks",
    summary:
      "Some RPG Maker events use little JavaScript snippets — a “Script” command, or a Conditional Branch that asks a question in code. Atlas now understands the most common ones: anything that just reads your switches, variables, or party (how much gold you have, who's in the group, whether an item is owned) is converted and runs for real, so those branches decide the right way in your game. Scripts that change game data, or reach for things Atlas doesn't have yet, are still listed honestly in the import report and left out — your game keeps playing either way. For safety, imported scripts only ever read game data; they can't change anything.",
    items: [
      "Read-only “Script” commands and Conditional-Branch “Script” conditions that use $gameSwitches, $gameVariables, or $gameParty now convert and run in Atlas.",
      "Supported reads: $gameSwitches.value(n), $gameVariables.value(n), and $gameParty.size() / .gold() / .members() / .hasItem(id).",
      "A conditional branch that asks a code question (like “is switch 3 on and variable 1 above 5?”) now picks the correct path when you play.",
      "Scripts that write game data (setValue, gainGold…) or read other data ($gameActors, $gameMap…) are listed in the import report and don't run — nothing is silently dropped, and your game still plays.",

    title: "Import report now explains your RPG Maker add-ons (plugins)",
    summary:
      "RPG Maker games often use add-ons (plugins) — little programs Atlas can't run. When you import a game, the report now has an “Add-ons” section that names every plugin from your project, remembers whether it was on or off and how many settings it had, and tells you in plain words whether Atlas already does that thing, does something close, or doesn't do it — with a pointer to where to look. Popular add-ons like quest journals, message boxes, and battle systems are recognized by name; anything we don't know is kept safely with an honest note. No plugin code is ever run — Atlas only reads the list.",
    items: [
      "The import report gained an “🔌 Add-ons (plugins)” section listing each plugin from js/plugins.js.",
      "Each add-on gets an honest verdict: “Atlas already does this” (quest journals → the Quests panel), “Atlas has something close” (message and battle add-ons), “Atlas doesn't do this — your game still plays” (pixel movement, lighting, HUDs), or “kept your settings, but it won't run” for add-ons we don't recognize.",
      "The report remembers whether each add-on was switched on or off and how many settings it carried.",

    summary:
      "Imported RPG Maker games look and sound like themselves now. MV's sheet-based battle animations convert into real Atlas animations (add the sheet image and they play frame by frame), and MZ's Effekseer effects honestly borrow the closest Atlas animation while keeping your own flashes, sounds, and screen shakes. The soundtrack grew a whole channel rack: victory/defeat/game-over jingles, looping background sounds like rain, remember-and-replay music, and volume/pitch/pan on music and sounds. Atlas-made games play exactly as before — every new behavior stays off until something asks for it.",

      "Victory, defeat, and game-over jingles: imported games play their own MEs at those moments, and the new Change Victory/Defeat Jingle command swaps them mid-game.",
      "Six new event commands: Background Sound (play/stop looping rain, waves…), Play Jingle (pauses the music and resumes it after — real ME behavior), Remember Music & Replay Remembered Music (picks up where it left off), Stop All Sounds, and Change Victory/Defeat Jingle.",
      "Play Music, Play Sound, and map background-sound layers now honor volume, pitch, and stereo pan — imported commands keep their RPG Maker mix, and the editor forms grew the same knobs.",
      "Replaying the music that's already playing with new settings retunes it in place instead of restarting it, just like MZ.",

    summary:
      "Maps caught up with battles. Tiles can now behave: tall grass hides your hero's feet, ladders make you climb, shop counters let you talk across them, and lava floors hurt to walk on. Maps can wrap around at the edges like a little planet, scroll a background picture behind the tiles, and bring their own battle backdrop. Vehicles obey events too. Everything is off until you turn it on — Atlas-made games play exactly as before, and imported RPG Maker MV/MZ games get all of it automatically.",

Battle events can now heal, poison, reveal, transform, or force-act enemies mid-fight; defeated enemies can drop loot; troops can hide a member until the story says “appear!”; and random encounters can open with a first strike or a surprise round. Win/escape/lose branches on Start Battle run for real, and party abilities like Double Gold work from any hero. Atlas-made games play exactly as before unless you turn these on; imported RPG Maker MV/MZ games get them automatically.",

    summary:
      "The battle system learned the whole RPG Maker trait book. Enemies and states can now carry traits (a Slime weak to Ice, a Silence that seals magic), skills and items can raise or lower stats for a few rounds, grow a stat forever, or teach a skill — and an optional TP gauge charges as heroes take hits and pays for special skills. Atlas-made games play exactly as before unless you turn these on; imported RPG Maker MV/MZ games get them automatically.",
    items: [
      "Traits moved into a shared editor and now live on Classes, Enemies, AND States — so a state can seal magic (Silence), blind a fighter (Hit chance down), or poison-proof a hero (Resist).",
      "Every RPG Maker trait converts now: counterattacks, magic reflection, magic evasion, critical dodge, HP/MP regen, attack elements (a fire sword really burns), on-attack states (a poison blade really poisons), extra attack hits, extra actions per round, attack speed, guard strength, healing received, physical/magic damage taken, EXP earned, how often enemies aim at you, always-guarding, and more.",
      "Skills grant and seal: a class (or state) can grant a whole skill type, seal one skill, or seal a type — sealed skills grey out in battle and in the menu.",
      "Buffs & debuffs: skills and items can raise or lower ATK/DEF/and friends by 25% a step (up to two steps) for a few rounds, with ↑/↓ pop-ups; Grow adds to a stat permanently and Teach hands over a new skill.",
      "TP: flip on “Show TP in battle” (System tab) or give a skill a TP cost — heroes build TP from damage taken and spend it on their big moves. New Change TP / Change Enemy TP event commands too.",
      "States got their full removal rules: walk them off after N steps, shake them off when hit, shed them when stunned, or clear them after battle.",

    summary:
      "Skills (and healing items) can carry a damage formula like a.atk * 4 - b.def * 2, and battles run it with the classic RPG Maker rules: variance wiggle, critical hits, guarding cutting damage in half, HP/MP draining attacks, and heals that restore a % of max HP. Games imported from RPG Maker MV/MZ get their custom formulas working automatically — and safely: formulas are read by Atlas's own checker, never run as raw code.",
    items: [
      "Skills have a new Advanced damage box (Effects & preview tab): an optional formula that replaces Power, plus Variance % and a Can critical toggle. a = the user, b = the target, v[n] = game variables, and Math helpers like Math.randomInt are allowed.",
      "Formula battles follow the RPG Maker order exactly: element rate, then critical (×3), then variance, then guard (half damage) — so imported games feel the way they did.",
      "Draining skills (HP Drain / MP Drain) give what they deal back to the attacker, and MP-damage skills hit the target's MP pool.",
      "Heals can restore a % of max HP on top of a flat amount — and items can too, including % of max MP.",
      "Accuracy and evasion from imported games now work: heroes with a Hit or Evade bonus can miss or dodge, with a MISS/EVADED pop-up. Atlas-made games are untouched — no bonuses, no misses, exactly as before.",
      "A formula Atlas can't run safely is kept, reported in plain language, and the skill falls back to its simple Power damage — nothing breaks, nothing is lost.",
