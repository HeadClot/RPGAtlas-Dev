/* RPGAtlas — src/platform/browser/project-repository.ts
   The browser ProjectRepository (Phase 1 Stage D): the editor's project-
   document store over localStorage, WRAPPING the existing
   js/editor/project-io.js load/save logic verbatim. Behavior-frozen:

   - loadProject() -> loadStoredProject(driver, migrate): same "rpgatlas_project"
     key, same "driftwood_project" read-fallback, same one-time legacy rewrite,
     same meta.engine gate, same formatVersion migration. Returns null when no
     stored project exists — identical to today.
   - saveProject() -> saveProject(driver, project): same key, same JSON.
   - hasProject(): true when either key holds a value (mirrors the load gate's
     own key precedence).

   The StorageDriver satisfies the {getItem,setItem,removeItem} shape that
   project-io.js already expects, so the wrapped functions run unchanged. The
   migration + validation callback is injected (the repository stays decoupled
   from js/data.js RA and the schema guard). GPL-3.0-or-later. */
