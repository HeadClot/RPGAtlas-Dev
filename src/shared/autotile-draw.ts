/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/autotile-draw.ts
   The one shared "draw a map cell" primitive (Phase 3 Stage D).

   Four cell-draw loops used to call `Assets.drawTile(g, id, dx, dy)` directly:
   the 2D editor canvas (map-render.ts), the live HD-2D viewport buildBuffers
   (hd-viewport.ts), the tile-paste preview, and the engine's prerenderMap
   (map-runtime.ts). Routing them all through drawLayerCell keeps autotile
   resolution in lockstep: a plain tile id falls through to the caller's
   `drawTile`; a reserved autotile id resolves its blob from same-group
   neighbours in the SAME layer array and blits the assembled 48x48 canvas.

 * matches its untransformed neighbour, so autotile shape resolution is unchanged
 * by the transform bits. (Flags are v1-scoped to plain tiles; masking here is
 * belt-and-braces so a hand-edited file can't confuse the mask.)

 * Central transform decode (Phase 8 Stage E): the stored value is split raw →
 * { id, flags } here, once, so all four draw paths (2D editor, HD-2D viewport,
 * paste preview, engine prerenderMap) get flip/rotate together. Autotile groups
 * resolve their own shape and are never transformed. Plain tiles with any flag
 * bit are drawn under a per-cell affine (rotate 90° CW / mirror about the cell
 * centre); the overwhelmingly common no-flag cell takes the identical fast path
 * as before this stage (byte-identical — goldens gate it).
