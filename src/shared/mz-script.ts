/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/mz-script.ts
   Project Compass M5·B: the minimal, READ-ONLY RPG Maker Script-command
   compatibility adapter (mig-0 decision D5, matrix §14). Two jobs, kept in one
   pure module (no engine/DOM imports) so the importer (editor) and the engine
   share exactly one definition of "the supported subset":

     1. analyzeMzScript(code) — the IMPORT-TIME GATE. Answers: is this snippet
        inside the read-only subset Atlas can honestly run? The subset is
        exactly `$gameSwitches.value(n)`, `$gameVariables.value(n)`, and the
        `$gameParty` basics `size()/gold()/members()/hasItem(item)` (D5), read
        only — never a write, never another `$game*`/global. Anything else →
        `{ ok:false }` and the caller emits an `mzTodo` + one honest report line
        (nothing is silently dropped — locked decision 6).

     2. the RUNTIME SHIM — `mzGlobalsFromState(state)` builds the three `$game*`
        objects from a plain game-state shape, and `runMzScript`/`evalMzScript`
        execute a gated snippet under the SAME `new Function` sandbox the Atlas
        `script` command uses (src/engine/interpreter/commands/flow.ts). The
        shim is read-only BY DESIGN — it exposes no setters, so a write can't
        even be spelled (D5: no write surface without a new gate decision).
