/* RPGAtlas — src/shared/schema.ts
   Typed project-document schema (Phase 1 Stage D). This file is the contract
   every later phase builds against: the full types are derived from js/data.js
   defaults + Atlas_Quest.json ground truth, with lightweight hand-rolled
   runtime guards used at project load/import boundaries only.

   Design notes:
   - The types describe the document as today's engine and editor actually read
     and write it. Where a field is optional in practice (author-set only, or
     backfilled by RA.migrateProject), it is optional here.
   - Fields the code reads with `|| default` or `== null` fallbacks are still
     typed as present-or-optional to match reality, never widened to `any`
     unless the underlying data genuinely has no fixed shape (tileProps maps,
     free-form asset blobs, plugin params).
   - The AnyCommand union enumerates every event command: the CMD_DEFS in
     src/editor/event-editor/command-defs.ts, which are exactly the types
     registered in src/engine/interpreter/commands/*.ts (43 as of Project
     Compass M2·A, which added the presentation family: pictures, tint, timer,
     scroll, balloons, scrolling text; M2·C added the actor-data family,
     M3·B the TP pair changeTp/changeEnemyTp, and M4·A the map-feature five:
     setVehiclePos/vehicle/vehicleImage/battleback/parallax) — plus `mzTodo`, the
     MZ/MV-importer placeholder (Project Compass M1·C): editor-rendered,
     preserved for re-import, and deliberately WITHOUT an interpreter handler
     so the engine silently skips it.
   - Guards WARN + pass through on unknown shapes; they never reject a project
     today's code accepts (behavior-frozen). See isProjectLike / assertProject.
