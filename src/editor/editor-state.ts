/* RPGAtlas — src/editor/editor-state.ts
   The editor's shared-state seam (Phase 1 Stage C, Package 1).

   The editor monolith was one big IIFE closure sharing mutable variables
   (proj, curMapId, tool state, clipboards, undo stacks, popup state …).
   This module lifts that closure state into one plain exported object so the
   extracted editor modules (map-editor/*, dom, modals, persistence, and the
   later event-editor / database / tools packages) can read and mutate the
   exact same fields the closure vars used to be:

     import { editorState as S } from "./editor-state";
     S.proj, S.curMapId = 2, S.undoStack.push(...)

   No framework, no reactivity: change notification stays what it always was —
   explicit calls (touch(), renderMap(), editorHooks.refreshToolbar(), …).
   `editorHooks` is the one indirection: named slots for functions that still
   live inside the editor.js closure (or in a not-yet-extracted package) but
   are called from extracted modules. editor.js registers its implementations
   at module-evaluation time, before boot() runs. Packages 2/3 shrink this
   registry as the remaining sections become real modules.
